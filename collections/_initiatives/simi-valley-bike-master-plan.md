In the next year Simi Valley will be updating it's [Bicycle Master Plan][1] which has not recieved any updates since 2008. This is a great oppertunity to have a positive impact on the saftey of our bicycle infastructure and encourage people to consider other modes of transportation within their local envrionment. 

A good example of this is [an article][2] we wrote detailing the importance of improving the active transportation infrastructure around portions of Simi Valley where residental and commercial activity is being focused.

# Timeline
> Current Status: Pre RFP

The City details the steps that will be followed to refresh its Bicycle Plan. They are as follows

1. **March 15th:** RFP (Request for proposials) sent out to contractors.
2. **June:** Contract awarded to contractor seen as best fit by city staff to fufil their requirements.
3. **June 2024 - 2025:** Contractor updates existing master plan. This includes...
    - Reviewing existing plans in the 2008 master plan.
    - Review of bicycle related collisions on city streets.
    - Conducting outreach to people who use the existing facilities or would be a good fit for a new system.
    - Solicit recommendation for new and upgraded facilities.
    - Final plan preperation.

We will be following this development closely. If you are interested in getting updates on the plan as it progresses, sign up for our mailing list or check back on this page every few weeks.

We look foward to working with the city and the selected contractor to ensure we have a plan that will serve our population for the next decade and encourage people to reduce their VMT when making local trips.
