# We advocate for better active and public transportation in Ventura County

<!-- # Advocates for better active and public transportation in Ventura County -->
We believe everyone deserves a house to live in. We think that people should not have to solely rely on a personal automobile to get their groceries. We think its a great injustice that our beautiful open space needs to be sacrified in the name of suburban spawl.

We live in such a beautiful area and should want to ensure as many people as possible can enjoy it.
